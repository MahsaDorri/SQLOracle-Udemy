#Oracle SQL Practice Repository
This repository contains my practice work for mastering Oracle SQL across various versions of the database:

*Oracle Database 11g
*Oracle 12c
*Oracle 18c
*Oracle 19c
#Why Oracle SQL?
Oracle is one of the most widely used relational database management systems in the world. Many large companies rely on it for their database operations, making Oracle SQL a valuable skill in the tech industry. By learning and practicing Oracle SQL, I am building a strong foundation for database development and enhancing my job opportunities in the field.

#What I've Practiced:
In this repository, youâ€™ll find the scripts and exercises I've completed to strengthen my Oracle SQL skills, including:

SELECT statements with complex clauses like *JOIN, *GROUP *BY, *HAVING, *OVER, and *PIVOT.
Practical usage of various Oracle SQL operators.
Working with numeric, text, date, conversion, aggregate, and analytic functions.
Manipulating data using *INSERT, *UPDATE, *DELETE, and *MERGE statements.
Creating and managing database objects such as tables, constraints, indexes, sequences, and views.
Solving real-world problems using Oracle SQL code, which has helped me reinforce my learning and apply SQL in practical scenarios.
#My Journey:
This practice has not only given me a solid understanding of SQL fundamentals but has also introduced me to more advanced concepts like:

Analytic Functions: Used to perform complex calculations over a set of rows.
Hierarchical Queries: Useful for managing hierarchical data structures in databases.
Pivot/Unpivot Features: Allowing me to transform data for reporting and analysis.
Each section of this repository represents real coding challenges I have undertaken to sharpen my skills, improve my confidence, and get hands-on experience.
